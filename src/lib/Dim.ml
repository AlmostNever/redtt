(* The [Atom] constructor is the only weird case. It is implemented this way in order to
   support diagonal equations, which we treat as different from the substitution of one
   dimension for an atom. In the case of a diagonal x=y, we generate a fresh atom 'z',
   and then replace both and y with z; except, using the [history] field, we remember that
   each one used to be x or y.

   When comparing generic dimensions, only the [atom] field is considered; but using the history,
   we can reconstruct the 'real' name of the dimension, which is crucial for quotation. *)
