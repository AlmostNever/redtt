This is my attempt to develop normalization-by-evaluation for cartesian cubical
type theory, using the interval and "extension types" to generalize path types.

The purpose of this is to develop a formal version of two-level type theory
which has good global properties, including (among other things) a rich and
decidable definitional eqivalence relation. NbE isn't the end goal, but rather
the tool we use in order to characterize algorithmic definitional equivalence.
We will use this as the proof theory for the successor to RedPRL.
