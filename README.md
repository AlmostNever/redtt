This is my attempt to develop normalization-by-evaluation for a cubical version of Observational Type Theory, which uses the interval and "extension types" to reconstruct the exact equality types of OTT. Once I get this working, I will add a second interval which will internalize higher-dimensional path structure, generating a two-level type theory.

The purpose of this is to develop a formal version of two-level type theory which has good global properties, including (among other things) a rich and decidable definitional eqivalence relation. NbE isn't the end goal, but rather the tool we use in order to characterize algorithmic definitional equivalence. We will use this as the proof theory for the successor to RedPRL.

In the `doc` folder, there is some TeX documentation of this type theory's evaluation and quotation semantics, and in the `src` directory I have a preliminary implementation of parts of it.
